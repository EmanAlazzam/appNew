        Ventilator (artificial breathing machine): is an automatic machine device provides all 
        or part of the work that the body must produce to move gas into and out of the lung"breathing". 
        Help patient to breath during the operation.
        Ventilators are chiefly used in intensive-care medicine, home care,
        and emergency medicine and in anesthesiology (as a component of an anesthesia machine).

        A pacemaker is a small device used to treat some arrhythmias. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. 
        Pacemakers send electrical pulses to help your heart beat at a normal rate and rhythm. 
        Pacemakers can also be used to help your heart chambers beat in sync so your heart can pump blood more efficiently to your body. This may be needed if you have heart failure.
        You may need a temporary (short-term) or permanent (long-term) pacemaker. 
        A temporary pacemaker is normally inserted through a vein in the neck and remains outside your body. 
        A permanent pacemaker is placed in your chest or abdomen. This topic focuses on permanent pacemakers.
        
        ECG: or an EKG can show how fast your heart is beating, whether the rhythm of your heartbeats is steady or irregular, and the strength and timing of the electrical impulses passing through each part of your heart. 
        You may have an EKG as part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. This test also is used to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks, arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat, and heart failure. 
        Results from this test also may suggest other heart disorders.

        Glucose Meter
        A glucose meter, also referred to as a "glucometer", is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood. 
        It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. 
        It is a key element of home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. 
        A small drop of blood, obtained by pricking the skin with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. 
        The meter then displays the level in units of mg/dL or mmol/L.
